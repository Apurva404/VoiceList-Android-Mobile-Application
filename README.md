# VoiceListApp
This is an android app, which facilitates the generation and collection of a list of items. The motivation behind the app is: 
 •To provide an easy user interface which enables end user to create the list of items she wants to buy (ex: grocery, utility list, 
stationary list) using her voice input. 
 •The user can open the app and add items to a list, whenever she remembers about an item to be bought and doesn’t need to type anything.
